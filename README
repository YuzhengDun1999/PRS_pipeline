----------------------- Description of PRS pipeline -----------------------  

This pipeline is used to calculate individual polygenic risk scores of chronic diseases with three inputs.
Inputs:
  1. Summary statistics of the chronic disease.
  2. Reference PLINK binary files (for example: reference files from 1000 genomes project )
  3. Individual genotype and phenotype information in PLINK binary files (for example: UKBiobank individual genotype and phenotype information).

Outputs:
  1. Polygenic risk scores of each individual
  2. Odds ratio per standard deviation unit of each predictor
  3. Confidence interval
  4. ROC plot
  5. AUC of the ROC plot

The pipeline is divided into two parts.
The first part is to calculate effect sizes of significant SNPs. The user can choose from three different algorithms: Lassosum, LDPred2, and Clumping and Thresholding.
Inputs required:
  1. Summary statistics
  2. Reference PLINK binary files
Scripts:
  Quality control of data:
    QC.R, QC.sh.
  Calculate effect sizes (choose one set):
    1. Lassosum: Lassosum.R, Lassosum.sh
    2. LDPred2: LDPred2.R, LDPred2.sh
    3. Clumping and Thresholding: CandT.R, CandT.sh

The second part is to calculate polygenic risk scores of individuals using effect sizes.
Inputs required:
  Individual genotype and phenotype information in PLINK binary files
Scripts:
  Use PLINK to calculate PRS (choose one set):
    Note: In this part, scripts of Lassosum and LDPred2 are the same. However, script of Clumping and Thresholding differs a bit.
          Please make sure you use the correct set of script for each algorithm.
    1. Lassosum: tune_script.sh, test_script.sh (in Lassosum folder)
    2. LDPred2: tune_script.sh, test_script.sh (in LDPred2 folder)
    3. Clumping and Thresholding: tune_script.sh, test_script.sh (in CandT folder)
  Model perfomance evaluation (choose one): Lassosum_prs.R; LDPred2_prs.R; CandT_prs.R

----------------------- Steps to Use ----------------------- 
1. Perform QC using QC.sh and QC.R
Note: Change parameters and paths in QC.sh and QC.R as specified in the scripts.

2. Choose one algorithm from Clumping and Thresholding, LDPred2, and Lassosum to calculate bete (effect size) values.
    Note: Change parameters and paths as specified in the scripts.
    Calculate effect sizes (choose one set):
      1. Lassosum: Lassosum.R, Lassosum.sh
      2. LDPred2: LDPred2.R, LDPred2.sh
      3. Clumping and Thresholding: CandT.R, CandT.sh

3. Calculate PRS and evaluate model performance.
    Note: Change parameters and paths as specified in the scripts.
    Use PLINK to calculate PRS (choose one set):
      1. Lassosum: tune_script.sh, test_script.sh (in Lassosum folder)
      2. LDPred2: tune_script.sh, test_script.sh (in LDPred2 folder)
      3. Clumping and Thresholding: tune_script.sh, test_script.sh (in CandT folder)
    Model perfomance evaluation (choose one): Lassosum_prs.R; LDPred2_prs.R; CandT_prs.R
